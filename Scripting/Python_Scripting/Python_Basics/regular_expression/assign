Parse Dates. 

Create a function that will decode a few common American date formats. For example, 3/18/87 is March 18, 1987. You might want to do 18-Mar-87 as an alternative format.  Develop the required patterns for the candidate date formats. Write a function that accepts a string and checks all patterns. It will return the date as a tuple of ( year, month, day ).
