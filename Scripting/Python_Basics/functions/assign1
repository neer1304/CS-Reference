Write a function that takes a numeric value from 1 to 9 and returns its English name (i.e., one, two .). If the input is out of range, return the original value as the name instead.

Taking the subroutine from the above, write a program to take two numbers and 
add them together, printing the result as .Two plus three equals five..
(Don't forget to capitalize the first letter!)
