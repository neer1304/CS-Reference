This directory contains two sets of programs to demonstrate the 
issue with endianness

1. First Program
The file in current directory "endianproblem.c" contains a piece of code
which demonstrates how endianness impacts a C program.
Please read the comments provided in the program to understand the issue


2. client-server program in the directories "issues_across_machines_..."
The client server programs in this folder have been created to demonstrate the problem that might happen due to :
1. big/little endianness
2. sending of pointers on IPC
3. different sizes of data types
Compile one of them(either the client or the server) on a big endian platform and the other one on a little endian machine and see the behaviour of the programs

Read the comments provided in the source code file.

There are two makefiles provided in the directory:
linuxmake: 
	use it to create the executables on linux(possibly on little-endian)

solarismake:
	use it to create the executables on solaris(possibly on big-endian)
